# Kuala Lumpur Property Market Analysis 2019

## Project Overview
This project analyzed a dataset of property listings in Kuala Lumpur to gain insights into pricing trends and factors influencing property values. The results provide valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals to make informed decisions in the Kuala Lumpur property market.

## Executive Summary
The Kuala Lumpur property market shows distinct segmentation, with properties below RM 1 million catering to budget-conscious buyers and those in the RM 1â€“2 million range appealing to mid-range buyers, while high-end properties above RM 2 million face affordability constraints. Premium locations like Bukit Damansara and Gurney command the highest prices, reflecting their exclusivity, while areas like Sentul and Salak Selatan offer more affordable options. Pricing trends reveal a positive correlation with features such as rooms, bathrooms, car parks, and furnishing levels, with bungalows and fully furnished properties leading in value. Budget-conscious buyers should focus on smaller, unfurnished properties in affordable areas, while mid-range and high-end buyers can prioritize location and premium features

- Bungalows and bungalow land typically command the highest average prices due to their exclusivity, larger land sizes, and often luxurious features. 
- Semi-detached houses, while not as exclusive, still command relatively high prices due to their larger size and amenities compared to terraced houses. 
- Terrace/link houses, particularly those with more storeys, tend to be more expensive than lower-storey options. 
- Condominiums and serviced residences offer a wider range of prices, with high-end units commanding significant premiums. 
- Apartments and flats are generally more affordable options, making them popular choices for first-time buyers and budget-conscious investors.

### Property Size

- While there is a general trend of increasing price with increasing size, there is also significant variation in prices for properties of similar sizes.

### Furnishing Type

- Fully furnished properties tend to have the highest mean price. Buyers are willing to pay a premium for the convenience of moving into a property that is already equipped with furniture and appliances. 
- Partly furnished properties, while not as expensive as fully furnished options, still command a higher price than unfurnished properties due to the inclusion of some essential furniture items. 
- Unfurnished properties, on the other hand, offer the lowest mean price as buyers need to invest in their own furnishings and appliances.

## Recommendations
### Budget-Conscious Buyers:
Budget-conscious buyers should consider focusing on more affordable locations like Sentul, Salak Selatan, and Chan Sow Lin. Opting for smaller properties with fewer rooms and bathrooms can also help reduce costs. Additionally, choosing unfurnished or partly furnished properties can save significant expenses on furniture and appliances. Apartments and flats are generally more affordable than landed properties, making them ideal for budget-conscious buyers. 

### Mid-Range Buyers
Mid-range buyers can consider exploring areas like Taman Desa, Taman Tun Dr Ismail, and Mont Kiara, which offer a balance between affordability and quality. Terrace/link houses and condominiums in established neighborhoods can provide good value for money. Prioritizing location and amenities is crucial, so look for properties in well-connected areas with easy access to essential services like schools, hospitals, and shopping centers.

### High-End Buyers
High-end buyers should focus on investing in prime locations like Bukit Damansara, Gurney, and Bukit Kiara, where property values tend to appreciate over time. Exploring luxury properties such as bungalows, semi-detached houses, and high-end condominiums with premium features and amenities can be a rewarding investment. Engaging a reputable real estate agent can be invaluable in identifying the best investment opportunities and navigating the complexities of buying high-end properties. However, it's important to be prepared for the significant maintenance and upkeep costs associated with such properties.
